The charge radii of neutron-deficient $^{177-185}$Hg nuclei have been investigated by resonance ionization spectroscopy at ISOLDE, CERN.  The isotope shifts of the 253.72 nm atomic spectral line were measured using the Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) operating in a reduced line-width scanning mode.  The RILIS was coupled for the first time to a liquid lead target by employing a newly developed laser-ionization mode of the plasma ion source. The measurements span the renowned region of nuclear shape-staggering, discovered at ISOLDE more than 40 years ago, revealing $^{181}$Hg to be its endpoint. The ground-states of odd-N isotopes below N=100 re-join the quasi-spherical trend observed in the even-N isotope chain.  The remarkable symmetry in the charge radii systematics with respect to N=104 is in agreement with the existence of the magic neutron number N=82. The results fill a long-standing gap in our knowledge of the macroscopic behaviour of charge radii near the Z=82 proton shell closure.
